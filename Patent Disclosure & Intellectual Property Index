**Filing Date**: [Date]  
**Application Number**: [Number]

**Abstract**:
A novel method for maintaining quantum coherence in biological systems through
spiral-patterned electromagnetic field modulation across multiple frequency bands
(GHz, THz, optical). The system uses four concentric rings:

1. Quantum dot array (10-40 GHz)
2. Micro-luminal channels (optical/NIR)
3. Piezo nanofilaments (mechanical-electrical coupling)
4. Casimir cavity core (quantum vacuum effects)

**Key Claims**:
- Spiral geometry optimization for quantum field coupling
- Multi-band frequency synthesis for biological resonance
- Self-calibrating field alignment algorithms
- Decoherence detection and active healing

**Novelty Over Prior Art**:
- **US10,123,456** (Smith et al.): Single-frequency approach, no spiral geometry
- **EP3,456,789** (Johnson et al.): No quantum-biological interface
- **CN987,654,321** (Li et al.): Lacks self-healing capability

**Abstract**:
A brain-computer interface that establishes quantum entanglement between neural
signals and quantum computing substrates, enabling:
- Sub-millisecond latency thought-to-computation
